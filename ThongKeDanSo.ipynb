    "This script is using Selenium, a web automation tool, to interact with a web page. Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Required Exception Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "from selenium.common.exceptions import StaleElementReferenceException: This imports an exception class used to handle situations where a web element referenced by Selenium is no longer present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n",
    "Defining the expanded Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The expanded function is an expectation, a Selenium concept used in explicit waits. It's designed to wait for a specific condition to become true.\n",
    "The function checks if an element, known to be present on the DOM, is visible. An element is considered visible if it is displayed and has a height and width greater than 0.\n",
    "The function returns a nested _predicate function, which is called by Selenium's wait utility.\n",
    "The _predicate function tries to get the \"alt\" attribute of the element and checks if it equals \"[Collapse]\". If the element has become stale (i.e., it's no longer in the DOM, which throws a StaleElementReferenceException), the function returns True.\n",
    "Defining Delay and Finding Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "delay = 60: This sets a delay of 60 seconds, which is used in the wait condition later.\n",
    "eall = list(driver.find_elements(By.XPATH,f\"//img[@alt='[Expand]']\")): This line finds all elements in the web page that are images with an \"alt\" attribute of \"[Expand]\" and stores them in a list.\n",
    "Iterative Click and Wait Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script enters a while loop, which continues as long as there are elements in eall.\n",
    "Inside the loop, the script clicks the last element in the eall list. This element is likely a button or a link that expands some content when clicked.\n",
    "WebDriverWait(driver, delay).until(expanded(e)): This line waits up to 60 seconds for the clicked element to become \"expanded\" (i.e., its \"alt\" attribute changes to \"[Collapse]\").\n",
    "After the wait, it refreshes the list eall by finding all elements that are still expandable.\n",
    "In summary, the script automates the process of clicking all expandable elements on a web page and waiting for each to expand before moving on to the next. This could be useful, for example, in expanding all sections of a dynamically-loaded web page."
